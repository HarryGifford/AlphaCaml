HOW TO INSTALL ALPHACAML

There are two components to install: the tool (alphaCaml) and the library
(alphaLib). Installation of the library requires Gerd Stolpmann's findlib
to be installed.

The installation steps are as follows:

  1. Make sure findlib is installed on your system. (If it is, then the
     command "ocamlfind" should be available and in the PATH.) If it is
     not, download and install it.

  2. (Need not run as root.) Compile the tool and the library.

       make

  3. (May need to run as root.) Install.
     The tool is copied into $(PREFIX)/bin.
     The library is installed via ocamlfind.
     The documentation is copied into $(PREFIX)/doc/alphaCaml.

       make PREFIX=/usr/local install

  4. (Optional. Need not run as root.) Compile the demos. (This requires
     step 3 to have succeeded.)

       make demos
