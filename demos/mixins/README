SUMMARY

A step-by-step evaluator for a call-by-value calculus of mixins,
known as MM, due to Hirschowitz, Leroy, and Wells. The definition
of MM can be found in `Call-by-Value Mixin Modules -- Reduction
Semantics, Side Effects, Types', in ESOP'04.

INTERESTING FILES

mm.mla		Abstract syntax for MM types and terms.

parser.mly	A parser and pretty-printer for our concrete syntax.
printer.ml	Nothing particular going on here -- these modules
		manipulate raw syntax, where names are just strings.

core.ml		The evaluator.
		Illustrates how to build and take apart terms that
		contain abstract names. The definition of mixin
		composition is particularly interesting: one of
		the operands is manually renamed so as to ensure
		that the two structures agree on their internal
		names.

main.ml		Puts everything together.
		Illustrates how to convert back and forth between
		raw syntax and internal syntax.
