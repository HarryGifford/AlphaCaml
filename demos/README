These demos are intended to illustrate the use of alphaCaml. They are not very
useful or very polished. They have not been seriously tested and probably
contain bugs. Suggestions for improvement are welcome.

The demos are:

lambda/
	Not a full demo. Only a sample signature file for an untyped
	lambda-calculus.

poplmark/
	A typechecker and evaluator for core System Fsub with records.

mixins/
	A step-by-step evaluator for a calculus of mixin modules.
